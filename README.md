# Overview

This is a astoroids inpired game with a medeval twist. 

In this game, the player navigates a dragon using the "A", "S", "D", "W" keys and use the "SPACE" bar to shoot fireballs. The player can destroy the oncoming towers using their fireballs for a point. There are also pigs that the player can collect that are worth 5 points. Each level of the game adds five towers to increase the dificulty as the game progresses. The level and score of the current game are displayed in the lower lefthand corner of the screen. The game also has a menu screen in which instructions are given and players can select the level of dificulty from the "Settings" screen.

The main purpose of writing this game is to learn more about the background set up that needs to happen for a game to run properly. This includes the managment of what the user is viewing at a certain time, how a user should be moving around the screen, and how to layer objects on the screen in a way that makes sense. It is facinating to learn more about the seemingly little details of a game that are run by vast stretches of code.
